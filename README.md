# Space Ranger Cinnamon

This is a small hobby project. It's a game about a kitten called Cinnamon and its space adventure. It's a rather simple space shooter game.

The game itself will be written in rust and it'll use the Bevy game engine. The goal is to compile the game to WASM, stuff it in React and host it as a static page.

The final game should look similar to this mockup:
